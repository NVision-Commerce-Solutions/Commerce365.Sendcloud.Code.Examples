# Creating Multicollo Shipments By Using Events
 
If you have multiple parcels or orders to be delivered to the same receiver address, you can create a multicollo shipment to combine multiple boxes into one delivery. Please first check with your desired carrier to see if they allow multicollo shipments. Some carriers even apply a discount when using multicollo instead of just shipping 2 or 3 boxes to the same address. 

This is also a useful example for everyone who is looking for information on how to manipulate Sendcloud shipments and parcels by using events.
